Project Directory Structure, Naming, and Convention 
Ant looks for a file named build.xml in the current working directory. Typing 
"Ant" on the command line executes Ant. In the absence of a build.xml file, a 
different file can be specified with the -d option. A comprehensive list of 
command line options can be obtained by executing "Ant" with a -help command 
line switch.
